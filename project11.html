      <h1>Hannibal-The Battle of Cannae</h1>
      
      <main>
        <p>After defeating the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene,
           Hannibal now moved forces down south. There was panic in Rome and Quitus 
          Fabius Maximus was appointed dictator to deal with Hannibal. Fabius, however 
          refused to meet Hannibal in the open field and this strategy became highly unpopular in Rome.
          Romans were used to attacking, not hiding. The Romans were forced to go on the offensive after 
          Hannibal positioned his forces between Rome and it's vital grain supply. This setup the epic Battle of Cannae.
          Here Hannibal defeated the Romans inflicting the worst single day defeat in Rome's history.
